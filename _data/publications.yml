  abstract: "The inherent technical, economic and environmental benefits of hydroelectric power make it an important contributor to the future world energy mix, particularly in developing countries. Turkey, with its great and intensifying need for power and water supplies, has abundant hydropower potential. This paper discusses policies to meet Turkey's growing electricity demand, emphasizing hydropower—especially small hydropower—as a key renewable energy source. Two case studies not included in prior assessments are presented, revealing Turkey's small hydro potential as a vital energy source, especially in the Eastern Black Sea Region. The analysis predicts that Turkey's hydroelectric potential could meet 33–46% of its electricity demand by 2020 and can be developed economically."

  abstract: "Belgrade, as a major cultural, scientific, administrative, and economic center, represents a significant energy consumer across all sectors. Using the MAED model, this study forecasts long-term energy demand across households, industry, and transport sectors to 2020. Several sustainable development scenarios are analyzed for different time periods, evaluating their sustainability using multi-criteria analysis based on economic, social, and environmental indices. The results offer decision-making insights for achieving sustainable energy development in urban systems."

  abstract: "This study presents a comprehensive long-term projection of Syrian energy and electricity demand for 1999–2030 using the IAEA's MAED model. Three scenarios—high economy (HS), energy efficiency (ES), and low economy (LS)—capture different trajectories of socio-economic and technological development. Results show that energy demand could grow annually by 5%, 4.5%, and 3% in HS, ES, and LS, respectively. Energy efficiency measures in the ES scenario could reduce demand by up to 5.7 mtoe by 2030. Electricity demand growth ranges from 3.4% to 5.5% per year, highlighting significant energy intensity improvements and conservation potential."
