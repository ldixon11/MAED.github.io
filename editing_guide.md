# Repository Editing Guide

This document explains how the repository is structured and how to edit its contents.  
All Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) tool websites (for example, MAED, FFRM, OSeMOSYS) follow the same structure.

---

## `_config.yml`

This is the main configuration file for the site.

It defines:
- Site title, description, and base URL  
- Theme (`jekyll-theme-primer`)  
- Navigation menus and site-wide links  
- Plugin settings and metadata  

Edit this file only to:
- Update the site title or description  
- Add or remove navigation items  
- Change theme or high-level configuration  

Reference: [Jekyll Config Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/)

---

## `index.html`

This is the home page of the website.  
It controls what visitors see firstâ€”such as the banner, summary text, and featured sections.

Edit this file to:
- Update homepage text and links  
- Change featured cards or sections  
- Adjust visuals or intro formatting  

Reference: [Editing Jekyll Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)

## Subpages

Subpages are written in Markdown, which makes them easy to update.

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `about.markdown` | Overview of the tool, its history, and objectives |
| `application.markdown` | Describes how the tool is applied and includes recommended readings |
| `learning_capacity.markdown` | Lists EMP training and capacity-building events (data-driven from `_data/learning_events.yml`) |
| `get_involved.markdown` | Describes ways to collaborate, contribute, or join the community |
| `dataset.markdown` | *(Archived)* Previously used for describing datasets |

Reference: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)  
You can also use basic HTML inside Markdown for finer control (for example, custom formatting or image placement).

---

## `_layouts/`

This folder defines standard page templates.

| Layout | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `home.html` | Used by the homepage (`index.html`) |
| `sub-page.html` | Template for About, Applications, and other content pages |
| `support-page.html` | Layout for help or resource sections |
| `form-page.html` | Used for forms (if applicable) |

These layouts automatically pull in the header, footer, and shared styles.

Reference: [Layouts in Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/)

---

## `_includes/`

Contains reusable content blocks used across multiple pages.

| Include | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `header.html` | Navigation bar |
| `footer.html` | Footer with partner logos and contact info |
| `coming_soon.html` | Standard placeholder for in-progress pages |
| `subpage_links.html` | Adds navigation links between subpages |

You can insert these blocks anywhere using:
{% include header.html %}


Reference: [Includes in Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/)

---

## `_data/`

Stores structured content in YAML format.  
This makes it easy to update lists and dynamic content without editing HTML.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `learning_events.yml` | Data for EMP events and adjacent workshops displayed on the Learning page |
| `publications.yml` | Recommended readings shown under Applications |
| `social_media.yml` | Social media links in the footer |
| *(Optional)* `rgs.yml` | Partner institutions associated with the tool |

Reference: [Working with Data Files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/)

---

## `assets/img/`

Holds all images used on the website.

| Subfolder | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `/EMP/` | Photos from EMP and related capacity-building events |
| `/partners/` | Logos of collaborating organisations (e.g., IAEA, IRENA) |
| *(root img folder)* | Tool logos, backgrounds, icons, and other general visuals |

ðŸŸ¢ **Tip:** Event image names should match their entries in `learning_events.yml` (e.g., `EMP-A 2025.jpg`).

---

### `assets/css/`

Contains style sheets controlling the appearance of the site.

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `custom.scss` | Defines custom site styling including fonts, colours, layout, and animations |
| `style.scss` | Base theme styling inherited by all pages |

All tool sites share a standard visual style, but editors can freely adjust colours and layout in `custom.scss` to match the toolâ€™s branding.

Reference: [Sass/SCSS Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide)

---

### `assets/js/`

(Optional) Contains any JavaScript used for animations, sliders, or other dynamic page elements.

## Gemfiles

Jekyll websites are built using Ruby dependencies defined in the Gemfiles.  
These files ensure that all contributors use the same versions of Jekyll and its plugins.

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `Gemfile` | Lists Ruby and Jekyll dependencies required to build the site |
| `Gemfile.lock` | Automatically generated after installation â€” locks dependency versions for consistency |

To build and preview the site locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve

## `README.md`

This file appears on the GitHub repositoryâ€™s main page.

Use it to:
- Summarize the purpose of the repository  
- Add links to the live site  
- Include contact or contribution information  

---

## YAML Data Example

To keep pages tidy, structured data such as event details are stored in YAML files.  
Example from `learning_events.yml`:

```yaml
- title: "EMP-A 2025 â€“ Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"
  image: "/assets/img/EMP/EMP-A 2025.jpg"
  description: "Hosted at UNECA, five national teams developed models..."
  outputs:
    - country: "Rwanda"
      title: "Forecasting Final Energy Demand"
      url: "https://zenodo.org/records/15364342"
```
